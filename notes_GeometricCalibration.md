## Geometric calibration

A manipulator can have small errors in link lengths, joint offsets, and accuracy. The task is to determine and compensate for the errors to increase positioning accuracy.

We can compare different poses of the manipulator with measurements from more accurate device such as Laser Tracker, and try to minimize the difference.

### Irreducible model creation

The first step is to build a model of the manipulator we are calibrating.
Here is the algorithm:

### Least-squares parameters estimation

The second step is to find the initial guess for parameters (which can also be acceptable as a solution). Here we do this with least-squares approach:

### Gradient descent
If the result on the previous step is not satisfying, we can use Gradient Descent to further minimize the cost function

## Results

Here are the results after one step calibration. To achieve better results, you can try iterating initial guess estimation. This, however, will not always work.

After this, you can do multiple passes with Gradient Descent. This has shown to improve the results. To make the optimization to be faster and more accurate, it is possible to provide Jacobian of the cost function into the least-squares method
